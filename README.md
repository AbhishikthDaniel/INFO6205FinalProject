2. Clone the project which uses Husky sorting with Below URL: https://github.com/rchillyard/The-repository-formerly-known-as
3. Add HuskySort(The-repository-formerly-known-as-master) to the build path of the INFO6205(INFO6205FinalProject) by following the below steps. 
    a. Right Click on INFO6205, ->Select "Properties" -> Select "Java Build Path" -> select "project" from tabls -> Selct add -> check Husky sort -> Click on "Apply and Close". 
       (this steps helps us in using the file form the other project) 
       
4. Run the Driver.java under the following path. 
    info6205/src/main/java/edu/neu/coe/info6205/sort/counting/driver.java
